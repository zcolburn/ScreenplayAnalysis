# Screenplay analysis


PDFs of free screenplays were scraped from [scriptreaderpro.com](http://www.scriptreaderpro.com/best-screenplays-to-read/) and their corresponding ratings were scraped from [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/). These data were visualized using ggplot2 in R and Tableau. Interactive Tableau visualizations can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/ScreenplayAnalysis/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes).


The five most frequent words in each movie , not including stop words, can be found in the file "Memory/top_words.txt".
